//Sample class just to have something in the include folder therefore
//being able to push it.

//namespaces are like folder in your code. Here to access Sample class you'll
//type sample::Sample. "::" is used to search inside namespaces. Class are
//also namespaces to acces a static function you'll go for 
//sample::Sample::static_sample();
//Note that you don't need to specify the namespace when you are inside the
//namespace. Hence to call static_sample from inside the class you just write
//static_sample();

//Never implements in .h as in C (well in some case you might want to but
//let's not talk about that now)

  class Sample
