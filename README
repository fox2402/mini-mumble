A small mumble like software with no GUI written in cpp.


How to use:
  cmake [DIR]
  cd [DIR]
  make
  mini-mumble [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -s launch as a server, will require adress as well as port either as
  options or with dynamic configuration. If not set, it will run as client

  -p [PORT] sets the port on which the server will listen, if -s is set
  and the port is not available, the server will fail to run. If -s is not set
  it will be the port of the server on which you want to connect

  -a [ADR] sets the adress of the server and will try to connect on this. If -s
  is set, the option does nothing

  -l [LOGIN] sets the login of the user, if -s is set, this option does nothing
  if none is passed, the default login is "defaultuser"

  -m [PASSWORD] sets the password of the server or the password required to
  connect. If -s is not set, requires -a and -p.
