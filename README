A small mumble like software with no GUI written in cpp.


How to use:
  cmake [DIR]
  cd [DIR]
  make
  mini-mumble [OPTIONS]

  options or with dynamic configuration. If not set, it will run as client

  -p [PORT] sets the port on which the server will listen, if -s is set
  and the port is not available, the server will fail to run. If -s is not set
  it will be the port of the server on which you want to connect

  -a [ADR] sets the adress of the server and will try to connect on this. If -s
  is set, the option does nothing

  if none is passed, the default login is "defaultuser"
