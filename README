A small mumble like software with no GUI written in cpp.


How to use:
  cmake [DIR]
  cd [DIR]
  make
  mini-mumble [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -s launch as a server, will require adress as well as port either as
  options or with dynamic configuration. If not set, it will run as client

  -p [PORT] sets the port on which the server will listen, if -s is set
  and the port is not available, the server will fail to run. If -s is not set
  it will be the port of the server on which you want to connect

  -a [ADR] sets the adress of the server and will try to connect on this. If -s
  is set, the option does nothing

  -l [LOGIN] sets the login of the user, if -s is set, this option does nothing
  if none is passed, the default login is "defaultuser"

  -m [PASSWORD] sets the password of the server or the password required to
  connect. If -s is not set, requires -a and -p.

  -n prevent the program from running the interactive configuration

  -v run the program in verbose mode


Network Messages:
messages between server and clients are regulated by some rules which are
explained below.

The message starts with 3 chars which represents the type of message followed
by the bytes of the message itself. Packet size is max 2048

  Client messages:
    - CON [login] the connect message ask the server if the client can connect
    the server can answer no if it is full, or ask for the passsword.

    - PWD [pass] the password message send the password to the server and
    request connection. If the password is correct the client is connected and
    can start sending other messages.

    - CHA [message] a simple chat message, should be send to all connected 
    client

    - VOI [bytes] a voice message, should work the same as CHA

    - DCT inform the server that the client is disconnecting

    - ACK confirm existence to the server
  Server messages:
    - ACK acknoledge message, used to confirm connection of a client
    
    - NOP refuses connection

    - PWD request the client to send the password

    - CHA [message] transfer of a text message

    - VOI [bytes] transfer of a voice message

    - CHK check if the client is still alive
